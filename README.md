# PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to dive further into the PyBer rideshare data and create a line plot based on three types of cities: Urban, Suburban and Rural. The data was sorted by city type and grouped by date into weekly categories where the fare in $USD was plotted.

## Results
The total rides, drivers and fares for more densely populated cities (such as Urban cities) far outweigh that of sparsely populated areas (Rural cities). Urban cities account for 68.4% of the total rides versus 26.3% for Suburban cities and 5.3% for Rural cities. Urban cities account for a similar percentage of total fares at 62.7% with 30.5% for Suburban cities and 6.8% for Rural Cities. When looking at total drivers, Urban cities carry a much larger percentage than the previously mentioned categories. Urban cities have 80.9% of the total drivers whereas Suburban cities have 16.5% and Rural cities have only 2.6%.

When looking at Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, it is the sparsely populated cities that have the higher numbers. Fares in Rural cities cost about $10 more, on average, per ride than fares in Urban cities. Each driver, on average, brings in about $39 more in Rural cities than in Urban cities. 

These results can be seen in the table below:

The total fare by city for the first four months of 2019 can be seen in the chart below:

## Summary
In conclusion, I suggest that more resources be put towards growing business in Rural cities. That is, more drivers should be hired or possibly transferred from Urban to Rural cities. The allure of a larger average fare should be enough to persuade drivers to move from Urban to Rural Cities.

The number of drivers in Urban cities should also be decreased. The total drivers in Urban cities are 2,405 while the total rides are only 1,625. This means that at least 780 drivers are not even able to work. 

I also suggest that pricing be lowered in Rural cities to attract more business. Drivers could still earn a reasonable fare per ride and could possibly have even more rides in a given week.
